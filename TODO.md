> NOTE: For Exestack's BytExecutor, there are several principles it must adhere to in decreasing priority

* Minimal clutter: The UI must contain as little clutter as possible. It can't be overflowing with widgets and buttons to click
  * Minimal actions: Most actions should be as few actions away as possible
  * Less used actions should never be more than two actions away
  * Commonly used actions should be a single action away

* High density: The UI should hold as much data as it can without clutter

* Intuitive: Most elements should be self-explanatory or have a tooltip for anything not obvious

* Elegance: The UI should look pretty when possible
