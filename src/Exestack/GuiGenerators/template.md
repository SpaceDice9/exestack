# Ok, why are we generating gui using code now?
Because directly importing them over from Studio is tedious and generates a lot of junk. Moving them here would make it easier both to maintain to eventually transition into a proper gui framework.

# How would we preview our gui?
The hope is that when we transition, there will be a ready-made ecosystem that allows for this. If not, we can create our own plugin to do this. Worst case scenario, we build our own framework.
